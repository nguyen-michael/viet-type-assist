# Vietnamese Type Assist

A PWA for typing out Vietnamese characters without using a soft or emulated keyboard. All of the tones and diacritic marks are presented as handy UI buttons. Good for quickly punching in a phrase or a few words without needing to switch to TELEX or another Vietnamese keyboard.
